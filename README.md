When the user submits the form, hide the form and display the list of items in alphabetical order, all uppercased.
Hint: To do this, build an array of the inputted items. (Make sure you don't include any blank fields.) Sort the array in alphabetical order. Make a new array with each entry uppercased (don't just uppercase them when you display them). Then, display the sorted list of things as list items inside a <ul>.
